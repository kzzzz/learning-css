<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>It's responsive. It relies on a maximum width value when viewed on large screens, adopts to narrow environments
        and picks the best viewable position relatively to the target (top, bottom; left, center, right);
    </li>
    <li>It's mobile-friendly. It pops up when a call-to-action button is tapped and disappears when tapped on the
        tooltip itself;
    </li>
    <li>It's HTML formatting capable. Need to write some words in italic or so? No problem, this will work out.</li>
</ul>
